/**
 * 419. Battleships in a Board
 * 
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Given an 2D board, count how many different battleships are in it. The
 * battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s.
 * You may assume the following rules:
 * 
 * You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
 * Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words,
 * they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1
 * column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell
 * separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.
