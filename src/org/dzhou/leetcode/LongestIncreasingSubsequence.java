/**
 * 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
 * 
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing
 * subsequence.
 * 
 * For example, Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
 * 
 * The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is
 * 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary
 * for you to return the length.
 * 
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
