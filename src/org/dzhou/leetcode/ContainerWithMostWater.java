 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point
 * at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints
 * of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with
 * x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 * 
 * Note: You may not slant the container.
